2. User B calls Loanr to set up contract - Loanr holds ETH
3. User A receives prompt with contract details
4a. On accept, receives ETH from Loanr. 
4b. On decline, ETH is returned to User B
5. User A can pay back any portion of the loan, with interest continuing to accumulate on the remaining amount
6. If the loan balance is not 0 by the deadline, User A is sent the punishment message
